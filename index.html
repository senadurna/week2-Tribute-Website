      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Frida Kahlo (July 6, 1907 – July 13, 1954) was a Mexican painter who
        became one of the most iconic and influential artists of the 20th
        century. She is best known for her emotionally intense self-portraits,
        which explore identity, pain, femininity, and Mexican culture. Born in
        Coyoacán, a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City, Frida's life was
        marked by physical suffering and personal tragedy that deeply shaped her
        artistic expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the age of six, Kahlo contracted polio, which left her right leg
        thinner than the other and gave her a limp. Despite her health
        challenges, she was an intelligent and ambitious student, dreaming of
        becoming a doctor. However, her life changed drastically at the age of
        18, when she was severely injured in a bus accident. She suffered
        multiple fractures to her spine, pelvis, and legs, and spent months
        confined to bed in a full-body cast. It was during this painful period
        that she began painting as a way to occupy her time and process her
        trauma.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frida’s early works were mostly self-portraits, painted using a mirror
        above her bed. She once said, “I paint myself because I am so often
        alone and because I am the subject I know best.” Her style combined
        elements of Mexican folk art, surrealism, realism, and symbolism. Her
        paintings often included visual metaphors, vibrant colors, and
        references to her physical and emotional suffering. She addressed themes
        such as infertility, heartbreak, political identity, and
        postcolonialism.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1929, she married the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Their
        relationship was passionate but stormy, characterized by infidelity,
        separations, and reunions. Despite the emotional turmoil, Diego
        supported her work and helped her gain access to the global art world.
        During the 1930s and 1940s, Frida exhibited her art in Mexico, the
        United States, and Europe, earning international acclaim. However, she
        often felt overshadowed by Rivera and struggled with chronic pain,
        multiple surgeries, and depression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout her life, Frida Kahlo remained politically active and
        fiercely proud of her Mexican heritage. She was a member of the Mexican
        Communist Party and infused her art with political and nationalistic
        symbolism. Her personal style—traditional Tehuana dresses, bold jewelry,
        and elaborate hairstyles—also became a powerful statement of cultural
        pride and defiance.
      </p>

    
      <p>
        Frida Kahlo died in 1954 at the age of 47. While her work received
        modest recognition during her lifetime, her fame grew significantly in
        the decades following her death. Today, she is celebrated not only as an
        artist but also as a feminist icon, symbol of resilience, and voice of
        personal and cultural identity. Her home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House),
        is now a museum visited by millions, and her legacy continues to inspire
        artists, activists, and thinkers around the world.
